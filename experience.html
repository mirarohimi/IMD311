		<p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;">&emsp; &emsp; I used to be a small business seller of Choco Jar when I was a candidate of SPM in year 2018. I did the business for fun with my friends since we wanted to gain new experience on that time. After SPM, with good exam result for me, I tried to apply for IPG which is <i>'Institut Pendidikan Guru'</i> and went to sit for exam and interview at IPG Pengkalan Chepa. Unfortunately, I did not passed. My life is full of ups and downs and it is normal to be sad when we could not get what we want. However, Allah knows better and the best planner for my life. I got my chance to further my study at UiTM Machang and become a Diploma student in Information Management where I get to learn new knowledge, experience and get to know wonderful people there.</p>

		<p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;">&emsp; &emsp; At UiTM Machang, I have the opportunity to get involved in so many leadership club activity. Firstly, I was an Exco Multimedia of HIMSAK which is <i>'Kelab Himpunan Siswazah Anak-anak Kelantan'</i> for session 2020/2021. HIMSAK really taught me how to be a good leader and I gained so many good skills especially soft skills for someone who is introvert person like me to handle any program. Not only that, I joined a music club with my other friends. I take part in Violet Master Crew band and participate in Colourguard section which is flag spinning. Despite learning in pandemic era of Covid-19, we still practicing through online together. Not forget to mention, I also participated in sport activity which is College Games or the short term is CGames in 2019. Me and my friends took part in Frisbee competition and we got the luck for winning the third place.</p>
